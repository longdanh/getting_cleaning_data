# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
The repository contains a sigle script, called run_analysis.R. This script contains the code for cleaning the data following the five
steps specified: 
 *  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 *  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 *  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 *  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
 *  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
In order to guide the process, the script has different sections which include the code for each part. It is important
to note that the file which contains the data must be downloaded and unzipped to make the script work. For more details about how the tidy
dataset is obtained, the CodeBook.md file provides more details about the development of the different parts of the project.
