# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
The repository contains a sigle script, called run_analysis.R. This script contains the code for cleaning the data following the five
steps specified. In order to guide the process, the script has different sections which include the code for each part. It is important
to note that the file which contains the data must be downloaded and unzipped to make the script work. For more details about how the tidy
dataset is obtained, the CodeBook.md file provides more details about the development of the different parts of the project.
